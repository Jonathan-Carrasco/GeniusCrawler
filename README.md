This python script takes url names and, after determining the 15 most frequent words, creates a word frequency dictionary with the word count of all 15 words for all songs in the song dictionary. After retrieving this dictionary, this program creates a csv file that contains information like song release year, duration, whether the song is explicit, number of spotify plays, and total word counts for top 15 songs.
